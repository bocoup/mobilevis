  <h1>What is MobileVis?</h1>

  <p>
    Data Visualization is common in every day communication on-line
    and in print media. As consumers shift to mobile devices for their daily information
    consumption on the web, we are faced with the challenge of designing new
    interfaces and interactions that work with these smaller screens. While
    <a href="http://n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">Responsive Web Design</a>
    helps alleviate some of these challenges, data visualization brings some additional
    challenges to the table having to do with specifically displaying and interacting with information.
  </p>

  <p>
    <span class="mobilevis">MobileVis</span>
    aims to provide both: A collection of examples (and discussion) of data visualization use on mobile
    devices as well as a collection of patterns that we identify from these examples.
  </p>

  <p>
    MobileVis is comprised of two parts:
    <ol>
      <li>A <a href="/">gallery</a> of examples of data visualization interfaces on mobile devices.</li>
      <li>A set of <a href="http://patterns.mobilev.is">patterns and observed best practices</a> for what works in data visualization on our smaller screens.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <h2>What Can I Do Here?</h2>
  <p>
    So much!

    <h3>View examples:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        You can view examples of data visualization uses on mobile devices and how they compare with
        their equivalent web interfaces. The home page contains many of these examples, and you can click
        the thumbnails to see more information about them. For example:

        <ul class="submissions">
          <li class="submission" data-submission-id="13">
            <a href="/submission/13" style="color:#6d6c6c">
              <div class="submission-content">

          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        Examples are <b>tagged</b> by their submitters. Tags can be visualization types,
        like <span class="tag"><a href="/tag/10" style="color:white">Bar Chart</a></span> or
        <span class="tag"><a href="/tag/14" style="color:white">Choropleth</a></span> or even
        areas of interest, like <span class="tag"><a href="/tag/17" style="color:white">Elections</a></span>.
        Clicking these tags will reveal other examples that were tagged the same way.
        When tagging examples of your own, try to reuse existing tags so we can build up these
        collections!
      </li>

      <li>
        Examples are submitted by users that are identified with their twitter usernames, like
        <a href="/user/ireneros">@ireneros</a>. Click the username to see other
        submissions by this user.
      </li>

      <li>
        Examples are usually from specific organizations or people, like <a href="/creator/The%20Boston%20Globe">
        The Boston Globe</a>. Click the name to see other examples from these organizations. It's a
        great way to see repeating patterns or templates that may have been used to create content!
