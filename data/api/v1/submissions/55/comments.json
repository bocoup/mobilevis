You have to swipe left and right to see other cities, pinch to see all 4 and zoom pinch to see details about a certain place. The menu allows you to set some options, but changing cities is not intuitive (you click the name of the city which starts the editing immediately.) Doesn't look like you can have more than 3 cities, plus current (which I couldn't actually get working.)","submission_id":55,"timestamp":"2014-06-25T20:08:57.000Z"}]
