[{"id":46,"twitter_handle":"ireneros","comment":"Interesting effect when scrolling on mobile - the text updates and has a bit of a bounce to indicate that happened. It's too bad there isn't a \"progress bar\" of some kind on mobile that would indicate how far down you've \"traveled\". Would be hard to replicate the mini map though.","submission_id":59,"timestamp":"2014-07-08T14:39:45.000Z"}]
