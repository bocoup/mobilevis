The interactive visualization Fatalities of 63 & 881 takes the user on a virtual trip along these treacherous stretches of road, using the up and down keys or the mouse to guide the car along each highway. Along the way, the interactive pinpoints sites of past fatalities and offers life-saving tips to reduce the risk of crashing, such as putting away your cellphone, turning off cruise control when driving in snowy conditions, and watching out for moose and other wildlife. \r\n\r\nA \"joystick\" navigation was created for mobile and tablets, to avoid tedious swiping. On the map view and on the victims view, filters were moved to a separate page.\r\n\r\nFatalities of 63 & 881 is a timely reminder that accidents do happen, and aims to encourage safer driving so that less Canadians lose their lives on the road.","images":[{"id":275,"submission_id":77,"url":"89bf1254-d203-47af-aa2c-5c02a09d1bad.png","timestamp":"2014-12-11T20:39:53.558Z","isPreview":false,"previewOffset":null},{"id":276,"submission_id":77,"url":"7986b60b-51d4-466f-b6d2-0e69285ba8d7.png","timestamp":"2014-12-11T20:39:53.561Z","isPreview":false,"previewOffset":null},{"id":277,"submission_id":77,"url":"dafcc5a6-22ca-4189-854d-de6831c03c5d.png","timestamp":"2014-12-11T20:39:53.564Z","isPreview":false,"previewOffset":null},{"id":278,"submission_id":77,"url":"c66b2e5b-119b-4fef-b24b-8ced12562c57.png","timestamp":"2014-12-11T20:39:53.567Z","isPreview":false,"previewOffset":null},{"id":279,"submission_id":77,"url":"404ac30e-a4bb-40be-8b45-cfce9cc7f3e6.png","timestamp":"2014-12-11T20:39:53.569Z","isPreview":false,"previewOffset":null},{"id":280,"submission_id":77,"url":"65db58ef-46ef-4834-b97f-f7e33a1f3ea3.png","timestamp":"2014-12-11T20:39:53.572Z","isPreview":false,"previewOffset":null},{"id":281,"submission_id":77,"url":"46012418-89c9-4a59-ba83-57baa1b56ab0.png","timestamp":"2014-12-11T20:39:53.574Z","isPreview":false,"previewOffset":null},{"id":282,"submission_id":77,"url":"f8020014-c410-4de5-a3d7-45ae806e8972.png","timestamp":"2014-12-11T20:39:53.576Z","isPreview":false,"previewOffset":null},{"id":283,"submission_id":77,"url":"8b828c77-c53a-42ac-bb87-073ecd879267.png","timestamp":"2014-12-11T20:39:53.579Z","isPreview":false,"previewOffset":null}],"tags":[{"id":37,"tag":"Gamification"},{"id":118,"tag":"map"},{"id":119,"tag":"fatalities"},{"id":120,"tag":"road"},{"id":121,"tag":"driving"}]}]}
